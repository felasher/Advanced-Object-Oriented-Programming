This program defines three classes: Student, Teacher, and School. The Student class represents a student with properties name, age, and gradeLevel. The Teacher class represents a teacher with properties name, age, and subject. Both classes have a method printInfo() to print out their respective information. The School class creates objects of Student and Teacher, and calls the printInfo() method for each. Finally, in the main() function, an instance of School is created and the method createObjectsAndPrintInfo() is called to execute the program.
